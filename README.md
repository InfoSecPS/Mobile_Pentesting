# Mobile_Pentesting
A repo for various Frida or Python scripts that I've created for mobile application tests. I'm not a developer. I Google code when I have an idea or problem to solve. 

## Android 
### shared_prefs.py [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/shared_prefs.py)

A script that downloads the entire contents of an Android application's `shared_prefs` folder on the device located at `/data/data/{packageName}/` - Pass the package name as the first argument. Script will download to the folder the script is executed from. Saves you having to ADB into the device and cat each file. 

### shared_prefs_monitor.js [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/shared_prefs_monitor.js)

A Frida script that monitors when an application is reading or writing to `shared_prefs` of an application sandbox. Run with `frida -U -l shared_prefs_monitor.js -f com.package.name --no-pause`
