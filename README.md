# Mobile_Pentesting
A repo for various Frida or Python scripts that I've created for mobile application tests. I'm not a developer. I Google code when I have an idea or problem to solve. 

## Android 
### shared_prefs.py [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/shared_prefs.py)

A script that downloads the entire contents of an Android application's `shared_prefs` folder on the device located at `/data/data/{packageName}/` - Pass the package name as the first argument. Script will download to the folder the script is executed from. Saves you having to ADB into the device and cat each file. 

### shared_prefs_monitor.js [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/shared_prefs_monitor.js)

A Frida script that monitors when an application is reading or writing to `shared_prefs` of an application sandbox. Run with `frida -U -l shared_prefs_monitor.js -f com.package.name --no-pause` 

### intents_watcher.js [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/intents_watcher.js)

A Frida script that monitors intents for an Android application. Run using `frida -U -l intents_watcher.js -f com.package.name --no-pause`. 

### sqlite_monitor.js [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/Android/sqlite_monitor.js)

A Frida script that monitors SQlite DB behaviour. Essentially showing what the application is writing to the database. Run using `frida -U -l sqlite_monitor.js -f com.package.name --no-pause`. 

## iOS

### bundle_ids.py [link](https://github.com/InfoSecPS/Mobile_Pentesting/blob/main/iOS/bundle_ids.py)

A Python script that quickly loads the bundle IDs for the installed applications on an iOS device. Saves time needing to SSH into the device and run the command, when you forget to grab the Bundle ID of an application.
